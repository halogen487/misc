# 〰️ Waves & Vibrations

A **wave** is defined by wibble-wobble wibble-wobble

## Types of Waves

- **Mechanical waves** are waves that pass through a substance, and make it vibrate. **Electromagnetic waves** are oscillating electric and magnetic fields which don't need a substance
- **Longitudinal waves** are waves where the direction of vibration is parallel to the direction the wave travels. It's like the slinky, **Transverse waves** are waves where the direction of vibration is perpendicular to the direction the wave travels, i.e. the rope.
- **Progressive waves** transfer energy. **Stationary** waves do not transfer energy, and instead stores it.
- **Wavefronts** are defined as lines of constant phase, perpendicular to **rays**.

## Measuring Waves

- The **displacement** (S) of a vibrating particle is just the displacement from equilibrium.
- The **amplitude** is the maximum displacement of a vibrating particle. In a transverse wave, it's the height of a peak or depth of a trough.
- The **wavelength** ($\lambda$) is the distance of one **cycle**. The **period** ($T$) the time it takes for that. For speed $c$:

$$
c = f\lambda
$$

- The **frequency** ($f$) is the number of cycles per second. The period is the reciprocal of the frequency; $T = 1/f$
- The **phase** of a vibrating particle at a certain time is the fraction of a cycle it's completed.
    - The **phase difference** of two particles is how far apart they are, usually in radians. The simple expression for this is, for distance $d$:

$$
\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}
$$

*I couldn't be bothered to find a wave diagram with all the definitions.*

A **ripple tank** is used to observe wave properties. It's a shallow tray of water with sloped sides to stop reflection.

## Polarisation

Transverse waves can be **polarised**, so they oscillate in a specific plane, or **unpolarised**.

This is used in polaroid sunglasses to reduce glare, LCD displays, 3D glasses, etc.

TV and radio waves are polarised by the rods on the transmitting aerials, so to read them well, the recieving aerial should be in the same plane.

## Superposition

When two waves meet, they combine and move apart. The 'principle of superposition' is that the total displacement at a point is equal to the sum of the individual displacements at that point. In other words, they add together. **Interference** is regular superposition.

**Stationary waves** are formed from the superposition of two progressive waves, defined by having a peak amplitude that does not move in space. In other words, they don't move. They also don't transfer energy to their surroundings, as long as they vibrate freely.

*The red wave is the stationary wave.*

The fixed points of no displacement are called **nodes**, and points of maximum displacement are called **antinodes**; both repeat every cycle. The **first harmonic** of vibration means the lowest frequency, which makes one antinode between two nodes. You can calculate its frequency by:

$$
f_1 = \frac{1}{2l}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
$$

where $T$ is tension and $\mu$ is mass per unit length.	$l$ is, of course, length. The second harmonic is just $2f_1$, the third $3f_1$, etc.
